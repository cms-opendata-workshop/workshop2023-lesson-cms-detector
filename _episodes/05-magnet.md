title: "Superconducting magnet"
teaching: 5
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What is the magnet in CMS and what does it do?"
objectives:
- "Learn about the magnet and how it works."
keypoints:
- "The CMS magnet is the central device around which the experiment is built, with a 3.7 Tesla magnetic field."
- "The magnet's job is to bend the paths of particles emerging from high-energy collisions."
- "The strong magnetic field, combined with high-precision position measurements in the tracker and muon detectors, this allows accurate measurement of the momentum of even high-energy particles."
- "The CMS magnet is a superconducting solenoid."  
- "The tracker and calorimeter detectors (ECAL and HCAL) fit snugly inside the magnet."
