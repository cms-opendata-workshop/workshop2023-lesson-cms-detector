### CMS detector design requirements

Detectors consist of layers of material that exploit the different properties of particles to catch and measure the energy and momentum of each one. CMS needed:
* a high performance system to detect and measure muons,
* a high resolution method to detect and measure electrons and photons (an electromagnetic calorimeter),
* a high quality central tracking system to give accurate momentum measurements, and
* a “hermetic” hadron calorimeter, designed to entirely surround the collision and prevent particles from escaping.
